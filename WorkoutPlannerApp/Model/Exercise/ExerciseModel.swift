// 1) the exercise name
// 2) the number of sets
// 3) the weight being done in each set
// 4) the number of reps per set

    // the function should be called after instantiating the class (i.e. when adding an exercise, ask for users to name the exercise first - this is the title - then, have a different popup/field that asks for the number of sets/reps and the weight)
    // may not need numOfSets later, just use setsInExercise.count
