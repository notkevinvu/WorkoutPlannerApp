// For fonts, must add the font to the app's assets/folder (can use the font book app to search and find the font files - can only use .ttf or .otf)
// After adding the app, must configure info.plist to show that we are using a specific font that we added (add a row, select "Fonts provided by application", add under the item's string)

    // for the string names, use font book and look at its info (click the info button top left after selecting it in font book) and use the postscript name
//    static let mainFontName = "Cochin"
    static let mainFontName = "SFProRounded-Medium"
